# FrontalAblation
30 April, 2022
This code is associated with a Nature Communications publication that will be updated when the mansucript is published and availible online

The code was developed from 2020 to 2022 to calculate the frontal ablation of Northern Hemisphere glaciers by Will Kochtitzky at the University of Ottawa.
This script requires many inputs that are combined to compute frontal ablation and you will not be able to run the script on your own without these specific inputs (see file paths in the jupyter notebook)
If you are interested in working with this script on your own, please contact me (willkochtitzky@gmail.com) and I can help you, gladly.

I have also included a yml file to set up the environment that I ran this script in. This can be installed with Anaconda.
