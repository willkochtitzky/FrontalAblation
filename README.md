# FrontalAblation
30 April, 2022
This code is associated with a Nature Communications publication that will be updated when the mansucript is published and availible online

The code was developed from 2020 to 2022 to calculate the frontal ablation of Northern Hemisphere glaciers by Will Kochtitzky at the University of Ottawa.
This script requires many inputs that are combined to compute frontal ablation and you will not be able to run the script on your own without these specific inputs (see file paths in the jupyter notebook)
If you are interested in working with this script on your own, please contact me (willkochtitzky@gmail.com) and I can help you, gladly.

I have also included a yml file to set up the environment that I ran this script in. This can be installed with Anaconda.

This repository has two scripts: one which will compute frontal ablation (without_plots) and the other which will generate all the plots in our publication (plots_only).

I apoligize that this code is not commented or well documented and you will not be able to run it without the file structures that exsist on my computer. However, please reach out and I am happy to help you with whatever relevent project you may be working on.
The script is unlikely to be updated as it is the script for a specific project and will need to be written differently when we update frontal ablation next.
If you need to make frontal ablation calculations for a specific glacier, or a group of glaciers, it will be much easier to do that on your own than to use this script. This script is designed for hemsipheric scale analysis and makes some assumptions to do that, which you can improve for specific locations where more expert knowledge exists.
